# project-two

## Proposal

### The names of all members of your group and a team name by which you will be known moving forward in the class:

-  Muhammet Aydin, Scott Benton, CJ Lambert, Connor Onweller, Will Walker

### A brief (one or two paragraph) overview of what the project is and what to expect from it when it is finished.

-  The application that we would like to design is a "pantry inventory system", designed to provide individuals with the ability to maintain accountability of the goods in their residence.  The goal is to provide homeownevers with the ability to track the quantity of groceries that are in their home as well as track what they will need to purchase when going to the grocery store.  This would be implemented through the use of three different collections: "Users", "Groups", and "Items".  The "Users" collection would track the platform's users tracking their login information and what groups they are a part of.  The "Groups" collection would track all of the users in a specific group as well as the "haves" and "wants" of the group.  This means that the groups would have their own inventory and shopping style lists.  This is also where item specific information, such as expiration data, will go.  The "Items" collection would track all of the items created by users to be added to various lists, also created by the users.  These items would contain product information such as "name", "quantity", "cost", etc.

### A brief (one or two paragraph) discussion of what project 3 will be like (the user interface).

-  Users have a few dashboards they can view: their grocery list, their current pantry, and some data visualizations about their activity using the application. In the grocery list, users can add new items and remove items they might no longer want to purchase. Additionally, expired items from the users pantry can show up as a recommended item that they can choose to add if they would like to repurchase. In the pantry dashboard, users can see all of the items they have recently purchased and any metadata assosciated with them; things like expiration date, food group or product category, cost, and quantity. In another dashboard, users can view data visualizations of their activity on the application and see what kind of products they most often buy, if they usually finish them before they expire (if the item is perishable), how much money they spend in a certain category. The idea is that users that belong to the same family (could be any kind of grouping of users: company, family, roommmates, etc) all see the same information in these dashboards and changes by one user are reflected for all users.
