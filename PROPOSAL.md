# project-two

## Proposal

### The names of all members of your group and a team name by which you will be known moving forward in the class:

-  Muhammet Aydin, Scott Benton, CJ Lambert, Connor Onweller, Will Walker

### A brief (one or two paragraph) overview of what the project is and what to expect from it when it is finished.

-  The application that we would like to design is a "pantry inventory system", designed to provide individuals with the ability to maintain accountability of the goods in their residence.  The goal is to provide homeownevers with the ability to track the quantity of groceries that are in their home as well as track what they will need to purchase when going to the grocery store.  This would be implemented through the use of three different collections: "Users", "Groups", and "Items".  The "Users" collection would track the platform's users tracking their login information and what groups they are a part of.  The "Groups" collection would track all of the users in a specific group as well as the "haves" and "wants" of the group.  This means that the groups would have their own inventory and shopping style lists.  This is also where item specific information, such as expiration data, will go.  The "Items" collection would track all of the items created by users to be added to various lists, also created by the users.  These items would contain product information such as "name", "quantity", "cost", etc.

### A brief (one or two paragraph) discussion of what project 3 will be like (the user interface).

### A brief listing of who will be responsible for what during the design and development process.
